# morphir-bosque

The morphir-bosque project is a Morphir sub-project dedicated to enabling [Microsoft's Bosque](https://github.com/microsoft/BosqueLanguage) as a modeling language for Morphir. 

## What
Bosque is a powerful language aimed squarely at eliminating many of the common issues that plague current programming.  Read more [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/bosque-programming-language/).

Morphir Application Modeling imagines development as:
* You code just pure business logic.
* That code is guaranteed to be free of exceptions.
* Your users have transparency into how your application behaves and why.
* Your application can be projected into a variety of runtime contexts.

## How
Generally, the flow would be:
1. Model your application in Bosque
2. Invoke the morphir-bosque tools to target supported Morphir tooling.
3. Deploy as desired.
